# Introduction
* The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. It operates by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

# Features
* Encryption: Encrypt plaintext messages using a specified shift value.
* Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same shift value used for encryption.
* Customizable Shift: Users can choose the shift value for encryption and decryption.
* Support for Alphabetic Characters: The cipher supports encryption and decryption of both uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
